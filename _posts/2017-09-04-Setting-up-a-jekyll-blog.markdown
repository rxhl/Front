In this quick and easy guide, we will setup a blog using Jekyll and host it on GitHub!

### **Prerequisites**

* Basics of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp)
* Knowledge of [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) and [GitHub](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/create_a_github_account)

### **What are we going to build?**

A minimal and static blog (like this one!) to be hosted on GitHub pages. We'll walk through the following:

* Learn what a static site generator is
* Install Jekyll
* Create a custom blog running on Jekyll
* Deploy the blog on GitHub pages

### **But what is Jekyll?**

>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

Okay, let's break it down. The usual way of putting up a website (or a blog) is to write some HTML, add in some CSS, put in some assets and host it on the server. In this process, we need to make sure that nothing is broken, all the links are working fine and the server is up and running. Imagine doing this for every blog post we write. Tedious, isn't it? 

Jekyll takes the pain out of it. It takes in our blog post (written in HTML or Markdown), puts it in a templating engine and generates static webpages so that we don't have to worry about the logistics. These webpages can then be hosted on GitHub for free! Also, Jekyll is blog-aware, so it can group our posts by date, categories and tags (more on this later).

Jekyll generates static webpages and so, it's faster than traditional CMS platforms like WordPress becuase there is nothing to be retrieved from the database. No database leads to fewer security challenges that are commonplace with CMS platforms.

### **Install Jekyll**

This guide has been written for Mac users and should be fine with Linux users as well. Windows users see this [resource](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation) first.

Weâ€™re going to install Jekyll locally before deploying anything to GitHub pages.

Jekyll is essentially a Ruby CLI and Ruby comes packaged with Mac. In case you don't have Ruby, you can get it from [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/). The first thing we're going to do is to install the Xcode Command Line Tools.

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

Now, we will install Bundler which is a package manager that will aid us in installing all the Jekyll dependencies.

```bash
$ sudo gem install bundler
```

Perfect, so we can now install Jekyll:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

After Jekyll is done installing, you should be able to look it up from the Terminal.

```bash
$ jekyll -v
```

Now, it's the time to create our blog! I'm going to create one on the desktop but feel free to choose any directoy you want.

```bash
$ cd ~/Desktop

$ jekyll new my-blog
```

Next, initialize a new Git repository.

```bash
$ cd my-blog

$ git init
```

And so, Jekyll generates a bunch of files within the my-blog folder.

<img alt="Blog structure" src="/Front/assets/img/1/generate-blog.png" style="width: 960px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:15px;"><em>Structure of the Jekyll blog</em></p>

Now, we just need to run the serve command:

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

The blog is now live and can be viewed at `localhost:4000`. Jekyll uses the port 4000 by default which can further be changed if needed. The minimal design of the blog is due to the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme that comes as default while creating a new Jekyll blog.

<img alt="Welcome to Jekyll!" src="/Front/assets/img/1/welcome-jekyll.png" style="width: 960px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:15px;"><em>Welcome to Jekyll!</em></p>

### **Customizing Jekyll**

So we have successfully created our first Jekyll blog and now we are ready to tinker with it. First, let's go back and see the structure of our blog directory. 

<img alt="Directory" src="/Front/assets/img/1/dir.png" style="width: 960px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:15px;"><em>Directory of the blog</em></p>

#### _config.yml
This is the Jekyll configuration file where we can store global variables. We are going to modify some values and add a few options so that it can be hosted on GitHub. Fire up your favorite text editor and change it as follows. Here's my finished file:

<img alt="_config.yml" src="/Front/assets/img/1/config.png" style="width: 960px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:15px;"><em>Modified _config.yml file</em></p>

 We can also add a Disqus comment box to our blog posts and Minima inherently supports it. Just add your Disqus [shortname](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208-what-s-a-shortname-) in `_config.yml` as shown above. That's it for now, we can come back and change `_config.yml` as needed. 

**PS:** Whenever you alter `_config.yml`, you need to run `$ jekyll serve` again to see the changes.

#### _posts
This is where we can write and store our blog entries. They can be written in HTML or Markdown, Jekyll is smart enough to convert them to webpages. Each blog post is named in a certain fashion: `YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post-title.md`. This way, Jekyll can organize and store the blog entries by date. An example blog entry would be `2017-09-04-first-post.md`. Here is my finished post:

<img alt="Blog post" src="/Front/assets/img/1/blog-post.png" style="width: 960px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:15px;"><em>Creating a blog post</em></p>

Now if we go back to `localhost:4000`, we can see our brand new blog post! 

Before we move further, let's analyze the blog post we just wrote. As shown in the image above, anything between the pair of ```---``` is a part of the YAML Front Matter and the stuff inside it can be used later in the post, this is the very beauty of Jekyll! And so, `page.title` within the double curly braces would render `Batman is awesome!`. More info on YAML can be found [here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

[Here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) is some extra info for writing blog posts (e.g. adding images, tables).

#### about.md

This is another page provided by the Minima theme to write some details about the author/organization/blog, pretty straightforward. We can edit it in Markdown or HTML or both!


#### Gemfile

>A Gemfile is a file we create which is used for describing gem dependencies for Ruby programs. A gem is a collection of Ruby code that we can extract into a "collection" which we can call later.

More info [here](https://tosbourn.com/what-is-the-gemfile/).

#### assets

This directory is not created by Jekyll, but by the user. Sooner or later, we'll have a need to add media and styling to our posts. This is where assets come into play. Here is an example of adding an image stored in our assets directory through Markdown:

```markdown
![Brief description of my-image](/my-blog/assets/img/my-image.png)
```

**PS:** It's a good practice to store the images within a separate directory inside assets.

Now, although we can add in-line styling in our posts but that's rather a cumbersome process. To add a custom CSS file, create a `main.scss` file within the `assets` directory. Here's my finished file with some styling:

<img alt="Custom CSS" src="/Front/assets/img/1/css.png" style="width: 960px; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size:15px;"><em>Adding some CSS to our post</em></p>

As shown above, we must include the YAML Front Matter and import the base theme. We can also write custom Sass and Jekyll will compile it for us!

#### _site

Recalling from the previous section, Jekyll is an engine that converts our posts to static webpages that can be hosted on a server. `_site` is where Jekyll places our finished webpages. 

So that was a wrap regarding the structure of our blog. It is up and running and ready to be shared with the world. In the next section, we will put our blog on GitHub and make it go live!

### **Hosting on GitHub**

GitHub is an excellent place to host static content. First, create a new empty repo on Github by your blog name. My GitHub username and blog are `rxhl` and `my-blog` respectively, so the corresponding Git repo URL will be:

```markdown
https://github.com/rxhl/my-blog.git
```
Link your local repo to the remote one.

```bash
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/rxhl/my-blog.git
```
By default, the files will be on the `master` branch. Create a new branch named `gh-pages`. 

```bash
$ git checkout -b gh-pages
```
If the sole aim is to host content, delete the `master` branch.

Next, commit your changes and push it to the remote repo.

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial commit"
$ git push origin gh-pages
```
*Voila!* The blog is now live at `https://github.com/rxhl/my-blog`.


### **Furthermore**

Hope this introduction to Jekyll will enable you to create your first (or 100th) blog/website. From here, you may check out the official Jekyll [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for more features or try out a few [themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) (I really like [Cayman](https://github.com/pietromenna/jekyll-cayman-theme)!).
